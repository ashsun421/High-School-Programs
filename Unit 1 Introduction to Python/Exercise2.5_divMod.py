# Description: A program that uses the mathematical operators // and % along with the numbers 1,6,7, and 8 to create expressions with the values 0-10
# Test Case: None because there is no user input
# 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10


# Process - Program does the mathematical expression for each variable

zero = (61//8)-7

one = (8%-1)-6+7

two = (-18%-7)+6

three = (18%-7)+6

four = (-8%-7)-1+6

five = (81//7)-6

six = (8//7)+6-1

seven = (18%6)+7

eight = ((8+1)//6)+7

nine = (67//8)+1

ten= (76//8)+1

# Output - Prints the answers for all the mathematical expressions
print(one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten)
