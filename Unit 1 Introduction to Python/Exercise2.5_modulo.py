# Description: A program that will find the remainder of any 2 numebrs being divided
# Test cases: 3/%2, 8%3, 10%4
# Input any number10
# Input another random number4
# The remainder of the two numbers is 2.0

# Input - User input two ranmdom numbers

x = float(input("Input any number"))
y = float(input("Input another random number"))

# Process - The program does the mathematical expression given

z = x%y

# Output - Prints the remainder of the two numbers

print("The remainder of the two numbers is",z)
